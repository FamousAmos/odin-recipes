  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Beef bourguignon is a traditional French beef stew. Auguste Escoffier, a legendary Franch chef in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, is credited with the dishâ€™s entrance into mainstream cooking, because it traditionally was known as a peasant dish. Beef bourguignon, or beef Burgundy as it is also known, consists of beef braised in red wine with onions, garlic, carrots and a garnished bouquet of herbs.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>3 cups Burgundy wine </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons brandy </li>
    <li>2 onions, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
    <li>1 sprig fresh parsley </li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>3 clove garlic, crushed </li>
    <li>10 whole black peppercorns </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
    <li>2 pounds cubed beef chuck roast </li>
    <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>1/4 pound bacon cubed </li>
    <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste   </li>
    <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste  </li>
    <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>For marinade: In a large bowl, combine the wine, cognac, onions, carrots, parsley, bay leaf, garlic, peppercorns and salt. Mix well and add the cubed beef. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 days.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
    <li>For Bourguignon: Strain the meat from the vegetables and marinade; reserve marinade. Dry meat with paper towels. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the meat and saute for 10 minutes, or until browned on all sides. Transfer meat to a separate medium bowl with a slotted spoon and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>In the same skillet, add the bacon and saute until lightly browned. Transfer the bacon to the bowl with the meat. Drain the skillet and return it to the heat. Pour a cup of marinade into the skillet to deglaze the skillet, scraping the bottom to loosen up all the little bits. Return this liquid to the reserved marinade.</li>
    <li>Heat the remaining oil in the skillet. Add the onion and carrot from the marinade, along with the additional onion that you've chopped, and saute for 5 minutes, or until tender. Transfer this mixture to the bowl with the meat and bacon, again using a slotted spoon, and return skillet to the heat. Add the flour to the skillet, combining with the oil and stir until well mixed and brown, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Now add the tomato paste, garlic, beef broth, reserved marinade and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and whisk to remove any flour lumps. Add this to the meat and vegetable mixture. Place entire mixture into a 9x13 baking dish.</li>
    <li>Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 3 hours, stirring occasionally and adding water as needed. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>About 15 minutes before meat is done baking, melt butter in the skillet over medium high heat. Add the mushrooms and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. When meat is done, add the mushrooms to the meat mixture, stir well and let sit for about 15 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
