  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Baked salmon is a popular dish that is unique from standard fish-based meals. While some prefer their salmon mildly flavored to maintain the straight-from-the-sea taste, others prepare it a bit more seasoned.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
    <li>6 tablespoons light olive oil </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried basil  </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper  </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley </li>
    <li>2 (6 ounce) fillets salmon  </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a medium glass bowl, prepare marinade by mixing garlic, light olive oil, basil, salt, pepper, lemon juice and parsley. Place salmon fillets in a medium glass baking dish, and cover with the marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator about 1 hour, turning occasionally.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
</li>
    <li>Place fillets in aluminum foil, cover with marinade, and seal. Place sealed salmon in the glass dish, and bake 35 to 45 minutes, until easily flaked with a fork.
</li>
  </ol>
